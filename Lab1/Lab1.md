- What is the current configuration of your on-premises infrastructure? Provide details about the hardware, software, and networking components.
- How do you handle an increase in traffic with the current infrastructure? Are there any performance issues during such times?
- How is data managed and stored in the on-premises environment?
- What security measures are in place to secure on-premises data and systems?
- What is the cost of maintaining the current on-prem infrastructure?
- What disaster recovery plan is in place in case of hardware/software failures?

## Migration Approach for Forever 21
**Rehost (Lift-and-Shift)** is the best migration approach for Forever 21. This approach involves moving their existing on-premises applications and databases to Microsoft Azure with minimal changes. It would address their immediate scalability needs and outdated infrastructure challenges without requiring extensive application redesign.

## High-Level Schedule for the Migration Process
1. **Planning (Week 1-2)**: Assess infrastructure, define objectives.
2. **Preparation (Week 3-4)**: Configure resources, prepare application/data.
3. **Migration (Week 5-6)**: Migrate to Azure.
4. **Testing (Week 7-8)**: Conduct performance and scalability testing.
5. **Go-live (Week 9-10)**: Transition to live operations.

## Main Decision Criteria for Forever 21
**Scalability** is the main criteria for Forever 21. As a fast fashion brand, they witness regular fluctuations in demand. Especially during the holiday season, their web traffic can spike to 15 times above average. The ability to quickly scale resources up or down in Azure will help improve website performance and ultimately drive higher sales.
